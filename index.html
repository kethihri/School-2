      <h1>Overview of Plymouth Creek Elementary</h1>
      <p>At <a href="https://www.wayzataschools.org/plymouthcreek" target="_blank">Plymouth creek</a> we practice Panther Pride. Students learn what it means 
        
        to be respectful, responsible, and ready to learn.
         
        Staff and students work together to practice empathy, kindness, and our commitment to academic excellence permeates within the walls of each classroom.
         
         We know that when students feel a sense of belonging, engaged in solid peer and adult relationships and they receive appropriate academic challenges, they experience success in its fullest capacity.
         
         We value the partnership between schools, families, and strive to build those connections everyday to maximize learning for each and every student.
         
          If there's anything I can help you with or any questions I can help answer, please don't hesitate to reach out.
